Troop 522 is collected donations to benefit Evelynâ€™s Wildlife Refuge in Suffolk, VA. For over 25 years, Evelyn's Wildlife Refuge has been providing shelter and rehabilitation services to orphaned, sick and injured wildlife in the Hampton Roads area and they rely solely on support from the community and their donor

The troop then created den boxes from wood and made tie blankets with Brownies. These supplies were donated to the Refuge to provide animals shelter, food, and medical supplies.
