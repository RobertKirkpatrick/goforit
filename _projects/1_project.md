## Introduction 

For our Bronze Project Award, Troop 522 wanted to raise awareness for Saving Native wildlife. The troop collected donations and built shelters to benefit Evelyn’s Wildlife Refuge in Suffolk, VA. 

## Evelyn's Wildlife Refuge

### About

### Our Visit

Our troop went to a rehabber that works with Evelyn’s Wildlife Refuge and we got to see baby racoons. We got to name the youngest and most adorable racoon Striper. It was hard to believe that this racoon was orphaned. We got to see all the baby racoons in a playpen. We got to see the toys that the rehabber used and how the racoons were taken care of. We also got to see pictures of some of the other rescued animals.

### How You Can Help 

You can support by making donations (see supply list). You can also take care of native wildlife in your area by planting trees and native flowers, don’t touch any wildlife just leave it be, and leave the wildlife better than  you found it.

### Examples of Animals in Need

* An animal gets hit by a car or run over.
* A baby gets separated from its parents.
* If an animal (bird that can’t fly yet) falls from a tree and gets hurt.
* A bone or shell is broken or cracked.
* If the animal has a possibly deadly disease that effects them.
* If it can’t fend for itself anymore.

## Bronze Project Award Accomplishments

### What We made - Den Boxes
We each painted our boxes with bright colors and designs. A total of 12 boxes were made.  Den boxes are wooden enclosures to simulate dens and burrows for animals in captivity such as: Foxes, Racoons, and Rabits.

        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/build_denbox.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

### What We made - Tie Blankets

Tie blankets are little blankets made to help keep animals warm and comfortable in their new habitat.

### Working with Brownie Troop 382

We worked with Brownie Troop 382 to make tie blankets.  We made a couple dozen blankets with fun, colorful patters, big and small. It was not a challenge to teach them how because some already kenw how to tie a square knot.  To make tie blankets you have to tie a certain knot, and a square not.  Althought some wehre unsure they caught on quickly.
